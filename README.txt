DESCRIPTION
===========

Link Weights is a utility module that allows you to rearrange the order that links 
display in the links section of nodes. For example, with this module you can display 
flags and commenting links before sharing and printing links.


INSTALLATION
============

1. Install & enable the module.

2. Go to admin/settings/linkweights and configure links per content type.  You must have at 
   least one node for each content type you wish to configure for the module to find out 
   which other modules use hook_link
